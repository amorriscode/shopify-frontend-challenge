## The Challenge

This repo contains my code for the [Shopify 2021 front-end developer internship](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ni/Shopify/ee14b4f1-62ec-4a47-850b-2311c57f855b-front-end-developer-intern-remote-summer-2021).

It's a small app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com).

I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because I like using React. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) makes it easy to get moving fast while providing a boatload of benefits. I try to spend my time where it'll have the most impact and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) helps with that.

Any styling super powers I have are thanks to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I love it, I bet you would too.

## The Developer

My name is Anthony Morris.

I'm an ex-software engineer turned computer science student. I'm doing things a little backwards, but hey, we're all on our own unique journeys, right?
